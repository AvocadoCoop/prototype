# Recycling

[Terracycle](https://www.terracycle.com/) will recycle a number of materials not accepted by our municipal recycling system.

The [Terracycle KW](https://www.facebook.com/groups/terracyclekw/) Facebook group has lots of useful information.

REEP Green manages a [map](https://reepgreen.ca/exploring-the-circular-economy-in-waterloo-region/) of locations that collect various items.

## Notes on recycling specific items in KW
[Waste Whiz](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/living-here/the-waste-whiz.aspx) works fairly well.
- Leave lids on plastic bottles with plastic caps.
- Remove metal lids from glass bottles.
- Tape must be removed from cardboard boxes.
- Staples do not need to be removed from paper.
