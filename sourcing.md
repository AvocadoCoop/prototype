## Cleaning

### Laundry

Tru Earth and Nature Clean make laundry strips

Pros:
- Recyclable Packaging

Con:
- Cost per wash
- Cleaning power


Full Circle Foods has bulk laundry powder

Pros:
- Likely inexpensive
- No packaging

Con:
- Won't dissolve in cold water (can pre dissolve in hot water)


### Stain Remover

Ideally you want something which can handle grease, organics (blood), and grass

Sunlight Bar

I think this is just a soap so it will handle tough grease stans but not much else

Full Circle has something... it isn't great


### Toilet Bowl Cleaning

Nature Clean makes strips as well

Pros:
- Recyclable Packaging

Con:
- Cleaning under the rim requires more scrubbing


There are silicon toilet brushes


## Compost

### Paper bin liner

The plain paper bin liner from bag 2 earth are hard to find. Home Hardware caries them. You can ask for a whole box but the price doesn't change.
